<h1 align="center">Sudoku Solver</h1>

Sudoku is a puzzle based on logic and combinatorial number placement. The goal in classic Sudoku is to fill a 9 Ã— 9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3 Ã— 3 subgrids (also known as â€œboxes") contain all the digits from 1 to 9. The puzzle begins with a partially filled grid, and a well-designed puzzle will have only one possible solution.

<h2 align="center">Rules</h2>

A sudoku is valid if and only if:

- A row contains all numbers from `1` to `9`.
- A column contains all numbers from `1` to `9`.
- Each of the nine 3x3 little squares contains numbers from `1` to `9`.

<h2 align="center">Goal</h2>

Given a sudoku grid as an argument, returns a grid filled with the right digits.

A Sudoku grid will be represented by a Python list of lists:

```python
grid = [
    [7,0,0,  0,0,9,  0,0,0],
    [0,0,0,  6,0,0,  0,4,0],
    [0,0,2,  0,0,0,  0,0,0],

    [0,0,0,  0,0,0,  4,0,0],
    [0,5,0,  0,4,6,  0,0,0],
    [0,0,0,  0,0,0,  0,0,0],

    [0,0,6,  0,0,0,  0,0,5],
    [2,0,0,  5,0,0,  0,0,0],
    [0,0,0,  0,0,0,  0,3,0]
]
```

The `0` represent empty slots that need to be filled with the correct numbers.

The goal is to solve this grid and return a grid represented as a Python list of list:

```python
grid_solution = [
    [7,8,4,  1,5,9,  3,2,6],
    [5,3,9,  6,7,2,  8,4,1],
    [6,1,2,  4,3,8,  7,5,9],

    [9,2,8,  7,1,5,  4,6,3],
    [3,5,7,  8,4,6,  1,9,2],
    [4,6,1,  9,2,3,  5,8,7],

    [8,7,6,  3,9,4,  2,1,5],
    [2,4,3,  5,6,1,  9,7,8],
    [1,9,5,  2,8,7,  6,3,4]
]
```


<h2 align="center">Idea</h2>

To make the program concise and easy to understand:

- Create a function to find a empty position.
- Create a function to check if row, col and box are valid.
- Create a function to make a recursive call until solving.
- Create a function to validate all the functions above.

In the end, use a sudoku_validator function to check the solution.
